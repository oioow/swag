    "## Key Details:\n",
    "*This is worth 25% of the module.  Since this is a 10-credit module, you should therefore expect to spend around **25 hours** of time completing this coursework.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Approximate weightings for each question are given in the provisional rubric, which is available on Moodle.  These may change slightly but you will be notified if that is the case.  Note that there are also marks for code quality and uploading the appropriate documents alongside this workbook as indicated in the provisional rubric.\n",
    "\n",
    "## IMPORTANT: Version History Tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to limit the use of AI tools (which are not permitted for this coursework as per the coversheet), I will be requiring access to the full OneDrive history of your coursework .ipynb file, i.e. THIS FILE YOU ARE READING NOW.  I will automatically check every version history for large changes that represent copy-paste from any other source - if you write your own code in the .ipynb file this will not cause any problems and you will be fine.  If you copy code from ChatGPT or others or try to disguise that you have, you will lose marks and be automatically investigated for academic misconduct.\n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as you read this message you should do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Save this file to your University of Nottingham OneDrive - everyone has their own University-linked OneDrive account which can be mounted as a drive on your machine (more info here: https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/dts/accounts-and-access/data-and-storage/data-and-file-storage.aspx).  Put the other files you will need, including <code>UKLoad2023.json</code> and <code>UKLoad2023_test.json</code> in the same folder so the code will run from there.  Do NOT use your own personal OneDrive!\n",
    "2. Mount your University OneDrive on your machine.  If you cannot get this working on your machine, you can alternatively mount it on campus in a computer lab, or by logging into the virtual desktop: https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/dts/communications/remote-working/virtual-desktop.aspx  There is therefore NO EXCUSE for not being able to access this file hosted on OneDrive and working from that version.\n",
    "3. As soon you have done this, you MUST share the file with me. This can be done by right clicking the file, type in my name (Minglei You) and share it with me with 'Can View' option. Once you have inserted my name into the sharing, please then click the 'Copy Link' button. You must then copy and paste this URL in the section below.\n",
    "5. You must then also click the 'Send' Button.  That way you can be sure I will have receive the link.\n",
    "6. If you are worried about whether or not I can access your version history, please check with me and I will check and confirm that I can.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You MUST share this file with me within one week of the coursework being released on Moodle**.  If you do not, I may consider this 'incomplete version history' and you may loose up to 8% of the total mark as per the rubric on Moodle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## IMPORTANT NOTES FOR ONEDRIVE VERSION HISTORY - READ CAREFULLY\n",
    "1. You must only use JupyterLab for your code writing and development.  Do not use VS code or any alternative tools else the version history may be incomplete.  Do not write separate .py files and copy them in later.  You can make sure that JupyterLab is autosaving your document by going to the settings menu and ensuring 'Autosave Documents' is selected:\n",
    "2. You must not create any new version of this file - if you are experimenting with code then create a new cell and you can delete it later if you like.  Do not use a separate file. \n",
    "3. Do NOT copy-paste from any other source.  I will check every single version history for any major changes in file size - if that happens then you will lose marks for not having a complete version history and will automatically be investigated for academic misconduct.\n",
    "4. Do not work offline - if your machine is not connected to the internet, OneDrive will not record version change information and so a large change in file size will appear.  This will result in 0 marks for version history and automatically trigger investigation for automatic misconduct."

    "   d) Any other Jupyter notebooks or .py files will not be marked so *ALL YOUR CODE SHOULD RUN INSIDE THIS WORKBOOK*.\n",
    "3. If you only submit the .html file without the .ipynb file, your code cannot be executed and hence not possible to reproduce and evaluate. Thus the marking will be based on your .html file for relavent contents, but a mandatory additional 50% of overall mark penalty will apply.\n",
    "4. If you only submit the .ipynb file without the .html file, you are missing the report and only containing source code file. Thus the marking will be based on your .ipynb file, but a mandatory additonal 20% overall mark penalty will apply.\n",
    "5. All submission should be made via Moodle, no email submissions are accepted.\n",
    "6. Late penalties will apply for any late submission, in accordance to the University policy. If you need to apply for an EC, please refer to the EC instructions on the top of Moodle page.\n",

Do not share your code with other people (do not share your screen either).** Whether you let someone else copy your code or you copy theirs you could still fail. It is fine and encouraged to help people, but you should explain concepts and not share exact code."

    "# Overview \n",
    "1. The general aim of this coursework is to make the day-ahead load forecasting based on the UK historical dataset. For day-ahead forecasting, you will need to rely on load profile from one day to predict the load profile for the following day. An accurate load profile will help improve the grid operations, especially the mitigating the challenge of intermittent renewable energy generations (e.g., wind and solar energy), to suppport economical dispatching/operation of energy storages (e.g., batteries and Electric Vehicles), and to apply smarter energy management strategies for cost saving and carbon reductions.\n",

    "   \n",
    "   c) to verify and report the result\n",
